# Drum Pad Simulator

This is a React application that simulates a drum pad. Users can interact with the drum pads to produce different sounds.

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS): A stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML.

## Features

- The App component initializes the drum pads with different sounds.
- A new React component, `Drum`, is created for each drum pad. This component is then added to the App component.
- The application includes a display that shows the description of the sound being played.
- Each drum pad can be triggered by a mouse click or by pressing a corresponding key on the keyboard.
- The `playSound` function is used to play the sound associated with each drum pad and update the display.
